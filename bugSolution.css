A more robust approach is to use more specific and independent class names for styling the child elements.  This improves reusability and maintainability.
```css
.child-class { /* Styles for child class */}
.parent-class { /* Styles for parent class */}
.parent-class .child-class-parentSpecific{ /*styles for child-class that are only applied when inside .parent-class */}
```
This solution makes the styling of the child class more independent and avoids the dependency on the parent's class unless you need parent-specific styles.  The `.child-class` can now be used anywhere in the project with its defined styles, while additional parent-specific stylings can be added via a more specific class name as shown with `.child-class-parentSpecific`.
